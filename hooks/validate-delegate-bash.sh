# PreToolUse(Bash) gate for the `antigravity-delegate` subagent. Claude Code's
# subagent `tools:` field can't scope Bash to one command, so this hook is the ONLY
# thing restricting what that subagent may run — it must allow a Bash call only when
# it invokes the plugin's delegation wrapper (agy-delegate / agy-job) and nothing else.
#
# Hardening (issue #29): the previous version matched the wrapper name as a SUBSTRING
# anywhere in the command, so payloads like `foo ... # agy-delegate` or
# `echo $(...) agy-job` slipped through (arbitrary execution under prompt injection).
# This version instead:
#   * requires the FIRST command token (argv[0], basename, optional .sh) to be exactly
#     agy-delegate / agy-job — a token check, not a substring match;
#   * allows NO pipeline at all. A producer allowlist was the second half of the #29
#     hardening and it is what GHSA-hwv2-vjgj-8rcv broke, twice over: `git` with
#     unrestricted arguments is a living-off-the-land binary (`git -c alias.x='!cmd' x`,
#     `--exec-path=`, `-c core.pager=` all execute arbitrary commands, all measured), and
#     `cat`/`echo`/`printf` feeding `agy-delegate -` reads any file or `$VAR` and ships it
#     to the external model. Allowing a command by NAME while ignoring its arguments is
#     not an identity check. Nothing needed the pipeline: this subagent's own contract
#     says the gate "blocks every Bash command except the delegation wrapper" and shows
#     only `agy-delegate [options] "<task>"`, and the documented
#     `git diff | agy-delegate --tier pro -` in commands/review.md runs as the MAIN
#     Claude, which this hook does not gate;
#   * rejects UNQUOTED shell metacharacters bash would act on (`; & | < > ( ) #`,
#     backticks, `$(`, and a NEWLINE — it separates commands just like `;`), while
#     permitting them INSIDE a quoted prompt (no false positives on legitimate
#     prompts — command substitution inside double quotes is still blocked because
#     bash would expand it). Leading/trailing whitespace is stripped first, so a
#     trailing newline is fine; an internal one is two commands and stays blocked;
#   * rejects PARAMETER EXPANSION (`$NAME`, `${...}`, `$1`, `$@`…) unquoted or inside
#     double quotes. With pipelines gone, `printf %s "$SECRET" | agy-delegate -` is
#     blocked, but `agy-delegate "summarise: $SECRET"` ships the same value to the same
#     external model with no producer at all. Single quotes and `\$` stay literal and are
#     allowed, and so is a `$` bash leaves alone (`$ `, a trailing `$`, `$'...'`). `$5` IS
#     an expansion (positional 5), so a prompt quoting a price needs single quotes or `\$`;
#   * fails CLOSED (block) if the JSON is unparseable or python3 is unavailable.
#
# On a block it prints the SPECIFIC reason to stderr before the generic message
# (issue #51). Claude Code feeds PreToolUse stderr back to the agent, so the caller
# can tell "you left a newline in" apart from "you tried to run something else" —
# previously both produced the same string and the agent retried the same shape.
#
# Input: hook JSON on stdin, with .tool_input.command holding the bash command.
# Exit: 0 = allow, 2 = block.
